# Ad-Hoc-Insights
# Introduction

Atliq Hardware is a leading computer hardware manufacturer based in India, with a strong presence in international markets. This project showcases business intelligence solutions developed for Atliq Hardware, focusing on data-driven insights and strategic decision-making.

# Problem Statement

Atliq Hardware identified a significant gap in its ability to make quick, data-informed decisions due to scattered and unstructured data across multiple departments. The absence of a centralized and query-efficient data system has led to delays in generating business insights, affecting strategic planning and operational efficiency. This project aims to design and implement a robust SQL-based solution to consolidate data, streamline reporting, and empower stakeholders with timely, actionable insights.

# Conclusion

This ad-hoc SQL analysis provided key insights into sales performance across various distribution channels, uncovering the revenue contribution of each channel with precision. By leveraging advanced SQL techniques such as CTEs, window functions, and proper join logic, I was able to ensure accurate and meaningful data aggregation.

These insights can support strategic decision-making by highlighting where the majority of revenue is generated and identifying potential areas for growth or optimization. This project not only reinforced my SQL proficiency but also strengthened my ability to extract actionable intelligence from raw data.
