# Ad-Hoc-Insights
**Introduction**
Atliq Hardware is a leading computer hardware manufacturer based in India, with a strong presence in international markets. This project showcases business intelligence solutions developed for Atliq Hardware, focusing on data-driven insights and strategic decision-making.

**Problem Statement**
Atliq Hardware identified a significant gap in its ability to make quick, data-informed decisions due to scattered and unstructured data across multiple departments. The absence of a centralized and query-efficient data system has led to delays in generating business insights, affecting strategic planning and operational efficiency. This project aims to design and implement a robust SQL-based solution to consolidate data, streamline reporting, and empower stakeholders with timely, actionable insights.
